227508	Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine .|In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nalozone , 0 . 2 to 2 mg / kg .|The hypotensive effect of 100 mg / kg alpha - methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone .|Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate .|In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) M , did not influence stereoselective binding of [ 3H ] - naloxone ( 8 nM ) , and naloxone , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 4 ) M , did not influence clonidine - suppressible binding of [ 3H ] - dihydroergocryptine ( 1 nM ) .|These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .|As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha - methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .	1:CID:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	58-61	51-52	D008750	alpha - methyldopa|alpha - methyldopa	Chemical	58:203	61:206	2:6	D007022	hypotensive	Disease	51	52	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	0-1	12-13	D009270	Naloxone|naloxone|Naloxone|naloxone|naloxone	Chemical	0:66:68:119:175	1:67:69:120:176	0:2:3:4:6	D006973	hypertensive|hypertensive|hypertensive	Disease	12:85:158	13:86:159	1:4:5	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	51-52	66-67	D009270	Naloxone|naloxone|Naloxone|naloxone|naloxone	Chemical	0:66:68:119:175	1:67:69:120:176	0:2:3:4:6	D007022	hypotensive	Disease	51	52	2	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	85-86	87-88	D003000	clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine	Chemical	6:25:87:137:177:201	7:26:88:138:178:202	0:1:4:4:6:6	D006973	hypertensive|hypertensive|hypertensive	Disease	12:85:158	13:86:159	1:4:5	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	25-26	51-52	D003000	clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine|clonidine	Chemical	6:25:87:137:177:201	7:26:88:138:178:202	0:1:4:4:6:6	D007022	hypotensive	Disease	51	52	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	85-86	58-61	D008750	alpha - methyldopa|alpha - methyldopa	Chemical	58:203	61:206	2:6	D006973	hypertensive|hypertensive|hypertensive	Disease	12:85:158	13:86:159	1:4:5
